\subsection{Problem formulation}
Different methods could be used for forecasting air pollution.
As it was mentioned in \cite{Shaban:2016} their work can be extended by considering data changes over time for real-time forecasting. It can be achieved by building online models that adapt automatically to environmental changes.


The purpose of this thesis is to study and compare methods of air pollution prediction suitable for real-time.

The information should always be up-to-date so air quality should be predicted in real time. We decided to study how different methods work for air quality prediction, how fast and accurate are they.
The outcome of our research is a comparison of methods for real time prediction for air quality time series.

Personalized air quality information
Compare linear and non-linear methods of time series prediction to see which is the best for real-time air pollution prediction





\par In overview \cite{Kang:2018} different machine learning techniques used in air pollution forecasting are presented. Itâ€™s mentioned that form observed machine learning methods only Neural Networks could be used for real-time prediction.

 LSTM Online Training and Prediction: Non-Stationary Real Time Data Stream Forecasting \cite{Press:2018}
 In his article author describes method that combines LSTM Recurrent Neural Network with statistical prediction methods to get higher accuracy. The model is developed to predict Exchange Rate for Bitcoin cryptocurrency, but could be also used for any data that updates in real time, in our case data from air pollution sensors.

\subsection{Smart city}
Smart City is a complex system that uses data from sensors to increase operational efficiency and improve the quality of life of its citizens.
An enormous amount of data is generated by different sensors in Smart City every day and it's impossible for a human to analyze it manually. The problem of analyzing such amounts of data is usually resolved by using Artificial Intelligence. One of AI applications is Machine Learning that provides the ability to manage tasks without being explicitly programmed for a system.
\\
As it was mentioned by Peng \cite{Peng:2017} environmental pollution could be controlled by a global system that is able to detect harmful situations. In particular this system could predict air pollution in the whole city in real time making this information available to all citizens.


In a smart city conception air pollution is monitored by a lot of small sensors. Prediction methods allow to forecast air pollution and warn citizens about the situation. Such awareness will allow to reduce risks for people sensitive to polluted air and encourage to ...
