The study has been preformed on M3 dataset.

Ways to preprocess data:
Transforming the data - Box-Cox transformation
Deseasonalize the data - if the strong correlation at some lag exists. Seasonal differencing. For this part the scatter plot is needed.
Detrending the data - ordinary differencing. Cox-Stuart test
Combination of above three

Result: Seasonal adjustments provide significantly better results in both sMAPE ad MASE


From statistical and machine learning algorithms ARIMA has the best MAPE on short term prediction.
The main result in this article is that despite most of the studies conclude that machine learning methods outperform
statistical methods it is not always true. In case of univariate data ES and ARIMA work much better than LSTM and also much faster.


ML issues:
Overfitting
Computational complexity

The one of the possible diagrams could be RMSE  to model fitting(%) and RMSE to computational complexity

The most fitted data doesn't mean that the prediction will be good

The characteristics of the data could be an issue about methods behavior
